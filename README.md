# Description

The project is a web resume for easy demonstration of the basic skills of a software engineer.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build:dev`

Builds the app for testing (via local static site) before deployment to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn run serve`

Serves a static site (after app building via 'yarn run build:dev').

### `yarn run build:prod`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run predeploy`

Runs prettier, linter, tests, then builds the app (via `yarn run build:prod`). Needs for deployment.

### `yarn run deploy`

Deploys app on Github Pages.

### `yarn run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `yarn run format`

### `yarn run lint`

### `yarn run lint:fix`

Formats/lints the code of app.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.

### `yarn run check-deps`

### `yarn run upgrade-deps`

Checks/updates available dependencies to the latest version.

### `yarn run prepare`

Lifecycle yarn script. Executes Husky installation.
